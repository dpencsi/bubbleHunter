### Following by [Franks Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl29qI62XPg) js game tutorial  I wonder what can I achive and learn.


### On the first stages just playing with some js stuff from the tutorial then give some additional changes like:

- change sprite
- add leaderboard
- mobile usage support
- add restart button when the player lose

### Current issues:
